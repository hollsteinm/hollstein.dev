              <p>A video game website for a hobby project of mine. I enjoy making games and I wanted to make a 'Classic Indie Horror' game with a slight twist. This project also involves working with local paranormal groups. This website is built using vanilla HTML and CSS. There is a sprinkling of vanilla JavaScript and JQuery. Not every project needs a framework. Deployed via AWS Code Pipeline.</p>

              <p>I was the sole contributor to building a mobile application for the Cream City Code conference in Milwaukee, WI. I build the entire stack using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Kinesis, React Native, AWS Web API, Cognito, Python, C#, and Javascript. The mobile app was to enable Sponsors capturing of booth visitors, Event Coordinator ticket registration, a prize raffle, and conference metrics. I also built the analytics backend for post-conference review and mobile application monitoring. To account for spotty Wi-Fi in our conference center, this application was fully functional offline. I also trained volunteers and sponsors in the mobile application. I also managed the device selection and purchasing for sponsors and event volunteers. I also ran the day of operations of the application stack.</p>

            <p>I am a certified AWS Solutions Architect. Centare was an AWS Advanced Tier Consulting Partner. This gave me the opportunity to participate in special events called AWS Immersion Days. Immersion Days are workshop approaches to using AWS. It can be a specific domain topic or technology topic. I participated in demonstrating the power of AWS for migrating from on-premise to the cloud using Cloud Endure.</p>
